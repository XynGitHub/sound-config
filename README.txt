MAKE SURE TO BACKUP/COPY YOUR SOUND FILES IN CASE SOMETHING GOES WRONG!

===========================================================================


go to the weapons folder and paste the .wav files in their respective folders, you dont need to edit them as they have been edited for immediate use


you will see some numbers on each folder, those are the different versions i used, its up to you to decide which one you like the most


i already said it in the first sentence, if you want the sounds to go back to normal just copy the backups you made and paste it back to the original file location


i plan to update this page if i make any changes or i use new sounds


enjoy.
